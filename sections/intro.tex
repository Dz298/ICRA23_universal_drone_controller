%Adaptive control for aerial vehicles has been a top priority for research for decades. 
% %
% It has achieved great access in extensive scales of applications from an indoor quadcopter~\cite{hanover2021performance} to a civil transport aircraft~\cite{doi:10.2514/6.2009-5738}.
% %
% However, with its approaches greatly evolving, it assumes access to the underlying model of the platform and hardware.
% %
% Adaptive control is greatly concerned with estimating and conteracting disparities between observation and a \emph{reference} model. 
% %
% This assumption leads one to wonder: what happens if we can lift such assumption? 
% %
% If so, the controller can completely bypass the notion of a reference model, which enables adaptation not only to disturbances and model uncertainties, but also to the morphology and hardware of the robot. 
% %
% This much wider range of adaptation can greatly save the labor-intensive process of designing controllers for quadcopters.
% %
% % Recent years have witnessed the growing interest in quadcopters due to its versatility in applications.
% % %
% % Such growing interest has lead to the emergence of commercially available and customizable quadcopters for hobbyists and researchers. 
% %
% Designing optimal controllers for quadcopters is challenging, as it requires accurate knowledge of the dynamics of quadcopters and careful controller design for desired skills. (basically copied from locomotion paper)
% %
% Poorly designed controllers can lead to suboptimal performances for quadcopters. In some cases, they may even become potentially danguerous for quadcopters such highly dynamic systems, since failure to control quickly leads to a crash. 
% %
% Flight stacks like PX4~\cite{PX4} and Beta-Flight~\cite{BetaFlight} have enabled the design process easier, but they still requires significant in-flight tuning for each quadcopter type and are generally tailored to human pilots.

% \todo{The joy of the design and assembly of a new quadcopter is generally followed by great despair.
% %
% Once the hardware is in place, getting the quadcopter into the air may apparently look like a simple task.
% %
% Well-established systems provide a simple way for generating trajectories and high-level controllers for tracking them (e.g., \cite{mueller2019trajectory,mellinger2012trajectory,kaufmann2020RSS}).
% %
% Such high-level controllers generally abstract action in terms of thrust and angular rates.
% %
% The interface between these actions and motor commands, physically executable by the hardware, is an \emph{appropriate} low-level controller. % that, e.g., meet certain specification on closed-loop time constants.
% %
% And here is where the headaches start.}

A classic model-based controller for quadcopters requires explicit estimates of the vehicle's model, including inertia properties (MMOI and mass), motor constants, and other parameters.
%
Errors in estimating such parameters directly translate to errors in the execution of the controller commands.
%
In addition, once the parameters are estimated, the controller typically requires specific tuning in-flight to achieve the desired behaviour.
%
% If the estimation and tuning is done right, the final performance will be very good.
%
% But what looked like a simple task required significant engineering effort.
%
A modification to the vehicle, e.g., replacing the motors with ones that have different properties, would require repeating the above steps in estimation and tuning.
%
Such significant engineering efforts could be eased with a single controller without specialized tuning. However, this problem raises several challenges since quadcopters are unstable systems. 
%
Large variations in quadcopter design have prompted the design of specialized controllers for different quadcopters, as opposed to one single controller. 
%
Rejection to disturbances or model uncertainties requires non-trivial design changes to the specialized controllers, which add more layers of complexity to the design work.
%
% Such engineering effort is compounded when the vehicle has variable properties, e.g., can carry different payloads or has a changing shape~\cite{falanga2018foldable,derrouaoui2022adaptive}.
% %
% Moreover, additional engineering effort and tuning is required if the controller needs to be robust against model uncertainties or external disturbances, e.g. aerodynamics effects or wind~\cite{shi2019neural, neuralfly, torrente2021data}.

% \todo{Introduction
% This section could be better organized to motivate why a
% universal controller is important, and why existing
% approaches do not serve as universal controllers. More
% specifically:
% Organization:
% Authors should provide motivation (e.g. autopilot without
% tuning) in the first paragraph before beginning a
% discussion on why the universal control problem is
% technically challenging.
% Authors should briefly state what their universal
% controller actually accomplishes (e.g. low-level control of
% thrust and angular velocity), which is not clear in the
% introduction.
% Discussion related to the technical challenge of the
% problem is scattered through the introduction and can be
% consolidated. 
% The reasoning behind why past approaches are not
% universal drone controllers should be better justified.}

% In this paper, we show the first universal controller for quadcopters. 
% %
% Quadcopters are inherently unstable and require high-frequency control of up to 500Hz. 
% %
% Failure to adapt to perturbations within fractions of a second can potentially lead to a crash.
% %
% Consequently, a universal controller should not only be able to handle diverse perturbations, it should do so very fast. 
%
% \todo{The introduction indicates that the controller is able to adapt to new situations within 0.8 sec (which corresponds to the window of 400 steps). But in Section V.C, empirical results indicate that the adaptation period is close to 2 secs.}
% 
In this work, we show a single near-hover position controller aiming to control a variety of quadcopters differing in mass, size, motor, propeller, etc. with mass and planar area size notably differing by at least 10 times. 
%
In addition, our controller can rapidly adapt to unknown in-flight disturbances in the mass and inertia changes of the quadcopters.
%
Our work builds on three main insights.
%
The first is that relevant dynamics parameters are observable from the history of states and actions.
%
This has long been known in the community: several works have shown how to estimate parameters online with nonlinear Kalman filters~\cite{svacha2020imu,wuest2019online} or with neural networks~\cite{forgione2021continuous}.
%
The second insight is that, at test time, we do not need an estimate of the parameters in some “ground truth” sense.
%
What matters is that the estimate leads to the “right” action, which our end-to-end training procedure optimizes for.
%
This simplifies the estimation problem and avoids observability issues, e.g., identical effects on unobservable or unmatched uncertainties~\cite{hovakimyan2010l1}.
%
% The third and final insight is that a system trained to adapt to a large variety of morphological and dynamical parameters is automatically robust to disturbances which are very difficult to model and to train on, \emph{e.g}, aerodynamics effects or swinging payloads.
%
% \todo{When the authors enumerate the three insights leveraged by their algorithm, the third comment about the algorithm being robust to disturbances within the convex hull of the training should be substantiated. }
%
The third and final insight is that a system can adapt to previously unseen disturbances as long as their effect on the platform dynamics is in the convex hull of the training disturbances (e.g., a motor losing efficiency has a similar effect to adding a payload below the motor).
%Therefore, future work should not spend effort on simulating all possible disturbances but on finding the minimal set of parameter changes to trigger a reaction.}
% we can train both the controller and the latent parameter identification module in simulation, where both the ground truth values and the state-action history are available. \antonio{The last insight is a bit less "insightful" than the others, maybe remove?}

To realize this, we follow an approach initially proposed for legged robots~\cite{kumar2021rma}. However, while that work performs online adaptation to terrains, we use their approach to adapt to a diverse set of quadcopters and perturbations. Specifically, we estimate a latent representation of the quadcopter's body from a history of sensor observations and actions, which conditions the behaviour of the controller.
%
%Such representation conditions the behaviour of the low-level controller.
% The space of quadcopter properties in which we train is extremely diverse (Table~\ref{tab:randomization}).
%
%\antonio{The flow here is okaish, but don't know how to improve it}.
%
The diversity of training parameters (Table~\ref{tab:randomization}) enables adaptation to sudden changes in environment conditions, e.g., a swing payload, for which it was not explicitly trained.
%
Our approach frees drone designers from the estimation and tuning process required any time something changes, or the risk that parameter changes unwittingly cause the control behaviour to significantly change, potentially endangering the system.
%
Furthermore, it naturally lends itself for use in off-the-shelf autopilot systems, allowing users who might otherwise lack the modelling abilities to control a custom vehicle, simply by plugging in the autopilot.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item You get a new quadcopter.
%     \item You want it to perform a simple trajectory tracking task, and have access to any one of a number of well-established trajectory generation and high-level control (e.g., \cite{mueller2019trajectory}). These high-level controllers often treat as control input the vehicle angular velocity, which is assumed to be tracked by an appropriate low-level control that, e.g., meet certain specification on closed-loop time constants.  
%     \item Such low-level control requires estimates of vehicle inertia properties (MMOI and mass), motor constants, and other parameters; errors in estimating such parameters directly translate to errors in the low-level tracking performance. 
%     \item Once these are estimated, the controller is typically tuned in-flight to achieve the desired behaviour.
%     \item If you do all steps right, you get a good controller. But what was supposed to be a simple task required significant energy and engineering effort, and modifying the vehicle (e.g., by replacing the motors with ones that have different properties, and different mass) would require repeating the above steps.
%     Moreover, if the vehicle has variable properties (e.g., can carry different payloads) the effort is compounded.
% \end{itemize}


% \begin{itemize}
%     %\item In this paper, we propose a way to escape this important yet tedious step
%     %\item we propose a learning-based controller that can autonomously adapt to a new vehicle or to changing parameters
%     %\item To do so, our approach estimates a latent representation of the quadcopter's body from an history of sensor observations and actions.
%     %\item Such representation conditions the behaviour of the low-level controller.
%     %\item Not only can our approach quickly adapt to a new body, but also react to sudden changes in environmental conditions, e.g. wind, a payload, etc, for which it was not explicitly trained for.
%     % \item Such an approach potentially allows for a much larger exploration in the drone design, since designers do not have to repeat the estimation and tuning process any time something changes.
%     % Furthermore, the approach naturally lends itself for use in off-the-shelf autopilot systems, allowing users who might otherwise lack the modelling abilities to implement a low-level controller on a custom vehicle, simply by plugging in the autopilot and not requiring any parameter tuning. 
% \end{itemize}


%\begin{itemize}
    %\item The first insight behind our work is that the body parameters are observable from the state action history.
    %\item This has long been known in community, with several work showing how to estimate parameters online.
    %\item While this can be done with filters, or with NN. The first is provable under assumption, the second general works across a larger variety of dynamics.
    %\item NN are also especially good at estimating parameters and at working over across dynamics.
    %\item Yet, prior work overlooked the possibility of estimating those parameters \textbf{at test time} and use them to condition the low-level controller.
    %\item The second insight is that we do not need to explicitly estimate the parameters.
    %\item What we need is a low-dimensional projection of them which is relevant for control. 
    %\item If a change in payload or inertia exhibit the same form of disturbance to the quadcopter, they need to be projected to the same point in the manifold.
    %\item This largely simplifies the estimation effort at test time.
    %\item The third and final insight of our work is that we can try both the controller and the latent body identification module in simulation, where both the ground truth parameters and the state-action history are available.

\caption{\small The training (top) and the deployment architecture of our system (bottom). We train in two phases. In the first phase, we train a base policy $\pi$ which takes the current state $x_t$, and the intrinsics vector $z_t$ which is a compressed version of the environment parameters $e_t$ generated by the module $\mu$. Since we cannot deploy this policy in the real world because we do not observe the environment parameters $e_t$, we learn an adaptation module which takes the sensor history and action history, and directly predicts the intrinsics vector $z_t$. This is done in phase two in simulation using supervised learning. We can finally deploy the base policy $\pi$ which takes as input the current state $x_t$ and the intrinsics vector $\hat{z_t}$ predicted by the adaptation module $\phi$.}

Our approach is related to existing methods in adaptive control.
%
However, our work shifts the meaning of adaptation to a different paradigm.
%
While adaptive control is generally concerned with estimating and counteracting disparities between observations and a \emph{reference} model, our approach does not have this notion. % of reference model.
%
This key difference enables adaptation to a much wider range of dynamics and disturbances.
%
In addition, it waives the engineering and tuning required by prior work when modifying the vehicle.
%
% Meta-learning is also related to the context of our problem in providing fast online adaptation.
% %
% Although they have been demonstrated on real quadcopters with impressive results on disturbance rejection~\cite{belkhale2021model,neuralfly}, they require real world learning samples to adapt.
% %
% When adapting to a much wider scale in our problem setting, this approach could be potentially dangerous for a dynamic system like a quadcopter, since failure to adapt quickly leads to catastrophic failure (a crash).
%
The closest related to our work are flight controllers in industrial systems like Beta-Flight~\cite{BetaFlight} and PX4~\cite{PX4}.
%
While they work well across a variety of vehicles, they still require significant in-flight tuning for each robot type and are generally tailored to human pilots.
%
% Finally, our work is also related to existing approaches in legged locomotion~\cite{kumar2021rma,lee2020learning}.
% %
% These works perform online adaptation to navigate a large variety of terrains.
% %
% However, while they adapt to different external factors (friction, terrain geometry, payload), they still rely on an accurate dynamic and morphological model of the platform \propose{to perform on one single robot}.
% %
% Therefore, changes to the robot would inevitably lead to re-training of the control policy. 
% \todo{Meta-RL}
% \propose{
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Meta-RL is also related to our method. 
%     \item It gathers real world data to learn a latent representation of unknown disturbances or model uncertainties, then uses the learned latent to augment the base controller's performance during test time~\cite{belkhale2021model,neuralfly}
%     \item They still just perform on one platform. 
%     \item Their approach may be dangerous in our problem with the much wider range of dynamics and disturbances for dynamics systems as drones
%     \item However meta-learning could be used to complement our work in the future for a better performance 
% \end{itemize}
% }
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Our approach is related to traditional adaptive control.
%     \item Adaptive control works well but still requires platform-specific design and tuning.
%     \item The closest related to our work are industrial systems like Beta-Flight or PX4.
%     \item They work well across vehicles, but they require tuning every time a vehicle changes.
%     \item They are also designed to work well for human pilots flight.
%     \item Our work is also related to existing approaches in legged robotics
%     \item There similar insights to ours have been used to unlock locomotion on a different set of terrains in a seamless fashion.
%     \item However, they show adaptation to different external factors (friction, terrain geometry, payload), but not to the robot body itself.
%     \item Indeed, they rely on a quite accurate system of the platform in term of platform geometry and actuation.
%     \item Some of them even rely on special purpose motor models which can only be trained with more than 30min of experience on the physical robot, and would need to be retrained any time the physical robot changes.

However, creating the control requires knowledge of system parameters, like inertial parameters, motor characteristics, etc. Thus, when implementing a model-based control on a new drone, the engineer typically has to spend significant energy on estimating parameters, and tuning constants, to get the desired behaviour. Having a system that can quickly adapt to a new vehicle, and keep adapting as the vehicle's payload and environmental conditions change, would make it much easier to control a variety of vehicles with minimum engineering effort.}
